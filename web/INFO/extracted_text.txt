Community
 
Building
 
 
We

collaborative
 
ecosystem

and
 
young

learn,

WHY
 
IWAJU
  
MATTERS
 
 
Africa
 
has
 
the
 
world’s
 
largest
 
youth
 
population
 
but
 
limited
 
access
 
to
 
advanced
 
tech
 
systems.
 
 

Most
 
young
 
innovators
 
lack:
 
 
AI-enabled
 
productivity
 
tools
 
 
Automation
 
workflows
 
 
Affordable
 
digital
 
assistance
 
 
Real
 
execution
 
support
 
 
Global-standard
 
technical
 
training
 
 
 
Iwaju
 
closes
 
this
 
gap
 
by
 
giving
 
African
 
youths
 
the
 
tools
 
and
 
systems
 
needed
 
to
 
compete
 
globally.
 
 
OUR
 
VALUE
 
PROPOSITION
 
 
We
 
build
 
real
 
outcomes
 
not
 
hype.
 
 
Fast
 
execution
 
 
Practical
 
solutions
 
 
User-centered
 
design
 
 
Globally
 
competitive
 
products
 
 
 
We
 
empower
 
people
 
to
 
be
 
10x
 
more
 
productive.
 
 
Everything
 
we
 
build
 
is
 
made
 
to
 
help
 
young
 
Africans:
 
 
Create
 
faster
 
 
Work
 
smarter
 
 
Learn
 
more
 
efficiently
 
 
Reach
 
their
 
goals
 
with
 
clarity
 
 
 
We
 
combine
 
innovation
 
+
 
community
 
+
 
execution.
 
 

Most
 
companies
 
focus
 
on
 
just
 
one.
 
We
 
focus
 
on
 
all
 
three
 
—
 
and
 
that
 
is
 
our
 
advantage.
